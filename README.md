# Reddons' Twitch chat Item pack

*NOTE: THIS PACK RELIES ON EXTERNAL SOFTWARE TO READ TWITCH CHAT! IT WILL NOT WORK INDEPENDENTLY*

I made a Random Item Giver pack for Reddoons with the added feature of allowing chat to vote on which item was given to the streamer

The pack worked serving nearly 1,000 concurrent viewers and updating seamlessly

The pack can be shown working in the livestream below
